      "Configuration of Python for scientific computing has historically been a huge pain, but recently has gotten a whole lot easier with the advent of two scientific distributions for Python that come with package managers: [Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/) by [Enthought](www.enthought.com), and [Anaconda](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/) by [Continuum Analytics](http://continuum.io). I have used Anaconda extensively, and find it a little easier because it's lighter-weight and is self-contained: it stays in a folder where you place it, doesn't touch the system Python, and doesn't require root/sudo access to install or modify packages.  This means it's easy to place on shared computing resources.  Best of all, it uses a package manager called `conda` that is extremely easy to use.\n",
